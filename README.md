## 📌Project Overview

This project presents a structured analysis of global oil and gas production, pricing, and export values across 187 countries over the period 1932–2014. The analysis was carried out to evaluate long-term energy trends, export value concentration, and population-adjusted economic impact.
The work focuses on understanding how oil and gas markets have evolved over time, identifying countries that dominate global exports, and assessing the relationship between energy value and national population size. 
The project translates complex, multi-decade energy data into clear analytical insights that support strategic decision-making in energy economics, policy planning, and investment analysis. 


## 🧩Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis  was sourced from “Kaggle.com”


## 🛠Tools and Technologies

1. Power BI – Data modeling, visualization, and interactive dashboards

2. Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, and validation

3. DAX – Measures, aggregations, and calculated metrics

## ⚙🧹Data Preparation

In the initial data cleaning phase, the following tasks were performed:

## 🧾Data Overview

## 📈Key Insights

### EXCEL ###

1. Average Oil Production by Year
   
*Insights*:

◻ There is a strong long-term upward trend in average oil production, indicating sustained growth in oil extraction over the years.

◻Production accelerated significantly after the early years, suggesting major discoveries, technological improvements, or increased investment.

◻In recent years, oil production appears to plateau, implying possible market maturity, production caps, or regulatory constraints.


2. Average Gas Production by Year
   
*Insights*:

◻Gas production shows a gradual increase initially, followed by a steeper growth phase, reflecting rising global demand for natural gas.

◻Short-term fluctuations indicate market sensitivity, likely influenced by price volatility, infrastructure expansion, or geopolitical factors.

◻Overall trend confirms gas as a growing complementary energy source to oil.


3. Standard Deviation of Oil Prices (Base Year 2000)
   
*Insights*:

◻Oil price volatility remains relatively low and stable in earlier years.

◻Sharp spikes in standard deviation during certain periods indicate high market instability, often linked to:
Global economic crises
Supply shocks
Geopolitical conflicts

◻Recent spikes suggest that oil prices have become increasingly unpredictable, increasing financial risk for producers and exporters.


4. Top 10 Net Oil Export Value Revenue by Country
   
*Insights*:

◻Saudi Arabia dominates global oil export revenue, confirming its position as a leading oil exporter.

◻Russia and Iran follow closely, highlighting their strong dependence on oil exports for national revenue.

◻Countries like Nigeria, UAE, and Norway show substantial earnings, indicating oil remains a major contributor to their economies.

◻Revenue concentration among few countries suggests global oil supply is highly centralized.


5. Top 10 Gas Export Value Revenue by Country
   
*Insights*:

◻Russia leads gas export revenues by a wide margin, reinforcing its influence in the global gas market.

◻Canada and Norway are strong secondary exporters, reflecting advanced gas infrastructure and export capacity.

◻Countries such as Qatar and Australia highlight the growing importance of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) exports.

◻Gas export revenue is more geographically diversified compared to oil.


6. Top 10 Net Oil & Gas Exports Value per Population (Average)
   
*Insights*:

◻Qatar and Brunei rank highest, indicating extremely high export revenue relative to population size.

◻Smaller nations with large reserves show higher per-capita benefits from oil and gas exports.

◻Larger countries like Saudi Arabia generate high absolute revenue but lower per-capita values due to population size.

◻This highlights how oil and gas wealth can have disproportionate economic impact in smaller economies.
