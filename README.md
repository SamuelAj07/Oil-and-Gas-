## 📌Project Overview

This project presents a structured analysis of global oil and gas production, pricing, and export values across 187 countries over the period 1932–2014. The analysis was carried out to evaluate long-term energy trends, export value concentration, and population-adjusted economic impact.
The work focuses on understanding how oil and gas markets have evolved over time, identifying countries that dominate global exports, and assessing the relationship between energy value and national population size. 
The project translates complex, multi-decade energy data into clear analytical insights that support strategic decision-making in energy economics, policy planning, and investment analysis.
