## 📌Project Overview

This project presents a structured analysis of global oil and gas production, pricing, and export values across 187 countries over the period 1932–2014. The analysis was carried out to evaluate long-term energy trends, export value concentration, and population-adjusted economic impact.
The work focuses on understanding how oil and gas markets have evolved over time, identifying countries that dominate global exports, and assessing the relationship between energy value and national population size. 
The project translates complex, multi-decade energy data into clear analytical insights that support strategic decision-making in energy economics, policy planning, and investment analysis. 


## 🧩Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis  was sourced from “Kaggle.com”

## 📈Key Insights

### EXCEL ###

1. Average Oil Production by Year
   
*Insights*:

◻ There is a strong long-term upward trend in average oil production, indicating sustained growth in oil extraction over the years.

◻Production accelerated significantly after the early years, suggesting major discoveries, technological improvements, or increased investment.

◻In recent years, oil production appears to plateau, implying possible market maturity, production caps, or regulatory constraints.


2. Average Gas Production by Year
   
*Insights*:

◻Gas production shows a gradual increase initially, followed by a steeper growth phase, reflecting rising global demand for natural gas.

◻Short-term fluctuations indicate market sensitivity, likely influenced by price volatility, infrastructure expansion, or geopolitical factors.

◻Overall trend confirms gas as a growing complementary energy source to oil.


3. Standard Deviation of Oil Prices (Base Year 2000)
   
*Insights*:

◻Oil price volatility remains relatively low and stable in earlier years.

◻Sharp spikes in standard deviation during certain periods indicate high market instability, often linked to:
Global economic crises
Supply shocks
Geopolitical conflicts

◻Recent spikes suggest that oil prices have become increasingly unpredictable, increasing financial risk for producers and exporters.


4. Top 10 Net Oil Export Value Revenue by Country
   
*Insights*:

◻Saudi Arabia dominates global oil export revenue, confirming its position as a leading oil exporter.

◻Russia and Iran follow closely, highlighting their strong dependence on oil exports for national revenue.

◻Countries like Nigeria, UAE, and Norway show substantial earnings, indicating oil remains a major contributor to their economies.

◻Revenue concentration among few countries suggests global oil supply is highly centralized.


5. Top 10 Gas Export Value Revenue by Country
   
*Insights*:

◻Russia leads gas export revenues by a wide margin, reinforcing its influence in the global gas market.

◻Canada and Norway are strong secondary exporters, reflecting advanced gas infrastructure and export capacity.

◻Countries such as Qatar and Australia highlight the growing importance of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) exports.

◻Gas export revenue is more geographically diversified compared to oil.


6. Top 10 Net Oil & Gas Exports Value per Population (Average)
   
*Insights*:

◻Qatar and Brunei rank highest, indicating extremely high export revenue relative to population size.

◻Smaller nations with large reserves show higher per-capita benefits from oil and gas exports.

◻Larger countries like Saudi Arabia generate high absolute revenue but lower per-capita values due to population size.

◻This highlights how oil and gas wealth can have disproportionate economic impact in smaller economies.

### POWER-BI ###

1. Overall Data Coverage - REWRITE
   
This dashboard analyzes oil and gas performance across 187 countries over a long historical period (1932–2014).
This wide coverage allows us to see global patterns, not just trends in a few oil-rich nations.

3. Average Oil Production
   
Oil production is very high on average, clearly showing that oil has been the dominant energy resource globally for decades.
Many countries have relied heavily on oil for energy supply and export revenue, making oil a major driver of national economies.

4. Average Gas Production
   
Gas production is lower than oil but still significant and steadily present across many countries.
This suggests that gas has played a supporting and growing role, especially as countries diversify their energy mix.

5. Oil & Gas Value vs Price (Year 2000)
   
Countries with strong production still earn heavily, even when prices fall.

7. Top Oil & Gas Exporting Countries (Total Value)

Russia and the United States lead by a wide margin.

Saudi Arabia remains one of the most influential oil exporters globally.

This shows that global energy supply is concentrated, making the market sensitive to disruptions in these key countries.

8. Oil Export Value: 2000 vs 2014
   
Average oil export value increased noticeably from 2000 to 2014.

Overall, oil remained a strong revenue generator during this period.

9. Gas Export Value: 2000 vs 2014
    
Gas export value also shows clear growth over time, similar to oil.

This indicates that gas is becoming increasingly valuable, supported by:

Expansion of gas infrastructure

Growing demand for cleaner energy sources


10. Net Oil & Gas Export Value per Population

Smaller countries like Qatar and Brunei benefit the most per person.

Larger countries earn more in total but less per person due to population size.

This highlights that resource wealth impacts citizens differently, depending on population and revenue management.
